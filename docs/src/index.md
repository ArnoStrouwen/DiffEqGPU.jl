# DiffEqGPU: Massively Data-Parallel GPU Solving of ODEs

This library is a component package of the DifferentialEquations.jl ecosystem. It includes
functionality for making use of GPUs in the differential equation solvers.

## The two ways to accelerate ODE solvers with GPUs

There are two very different ways that one can
accelerate an ODE solution with GPUs. There is one case where `u` is very big and `f`
is very expensive but very structured, and you use GPUs to accelerate the computation
of said `f`. The other use case is where `u` is very small but you want to solve the ODE
`f` over many different initial conditions (`u0`) or parameters `p`. In that case, you can
use GPUs to parallelize over different parameters and initial conditions. In other words:

| Type of Problem                           | SciML Solution                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accelerate a big ODE                      | Use [CUDA.jl's](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/) CuArray as `u0`                                       |
| Solve the same ODE with many `u0` and `p` | Use [DiffEqGPU.jl's](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqGPU/stable/) `EnsembleGPUArray` and `EnsembleGPUKernel` |

## Example of Within-Method GPU Parallelism

```julia
using OrdinaryDiffEq, CUDA, LinearAlgebra
u0 = cu(rand(1000))
A  = cu(randn(1000,1000))
f(du,u,p,t)  = mul!(du,A,u)
prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,(0.0f0,1.0f0)) # Float32 is better on GPUs!
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5())
```

## Example of Parameter-Parallelism with GPU Ensemble Methods

```julia
using DiffEqGPU, OrdinaryDiffEq, StaticArrays

function lorenz(u, p, t)
    σ = p[1]
    ρ = p[2]
    β = p[3]
    du1 = σ * (u[2] - u[1])
    du2 = u[1] * (ρ - u[3]) - u[2]
    du3 = u[1] * u[2] - β * u[3]
    return SVector{3}(du1, du2, du3)
end

u0 = @SVector [1.0f0; 0.0f0; 0.0f0]
tspan = (0.0f0, 10.0f0)
p = @SVector [10.0f0, 28.0f0, 8 / 3.0f0]
prob = ODEProblem{false}(lorenz, u0, tspan, p)
prob_func = (prob, i, repeat) -> remake(prob, p = (@SVector rand(Float32, 3)).*p)
monteprob = EnsembleProblem(prob, prob_func = prob_func, safetycopy = false)

@time sol = solve(monteprob, GPUTsit5(), EnsembleGPUKernel(), trajectories = 10_000, adaptive = false, dt = 0.1f0)
```
